This version represents a new random draw of assets.  The colors in the first market are reversed from the original draw.  For instance, the highest asset is now colored cyan and the lowest
is now colored green in the first market.  The second market use to have blue and gold, but here all markets have cyan and green.

Additionally, there is now a table and a graph of the potentially superstar assets at periods 4 and 5.  The highlighted assets are the one that increased the most and the one that increased 
second most.  If there are two that are tied for increasing the most (or second most), the one that is picked is the one that comes first in alphabetical order.
