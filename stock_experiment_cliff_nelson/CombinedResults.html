    <p style = "margin-left:40px"> {{ player.shares_acquired_3}} share(s) of stock {{ player.stock_3 }} in the first
        market.  {{ player.stock_3 }} has a final payout of {{ player.payoff_3 }}.
        Therefore, you earned {{ player.earnings_3 }}. </p>

    <p style = "margin-left:40px"> {{ player.shares_acquired_3_2}} share(s) of stock {{ player.stock_3_2 }} in the first
        market. {{ player.stock_3_2 }} which had a final payout of {{ player.payoff_3_2 }}.
        Therefore, you earned {{ player.earnings_3_2 }}. </p>

    <p style = "margin-left:40px"> {{ player.shares_acquired_6}} share(s) of stock {{ player.stock_6 }} in the second
